# AstroSat-SSM-Project-2020
This contains the codes for the AstroSat SSM Project 2020, where I had developed a code for identifying the thermonuclear outbursts from neutron star systems. For fitting purpose, Fast Rise Exponential Decay (FRED) model along with other simple models like exponential decay, dipping linear fits and step function fits are used.
